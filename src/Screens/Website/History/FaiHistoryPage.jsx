                  of India in 2017. Shri Bashir Ahmed Khan of Chhattisgarh and
                  Ashok Dudhare of Maharashtra elected as secretary and
                  treasurer respectively. Fencing Association caught pace in the
                  overall development in presence of Shree Rajiv Mehta. His
                  management, hard work, skill and intense practice in sports
                  have paid of. Many pending cases in the sports ministry are
                  resolved in a positive way such as fencing up gradation in
                  priority games; it is only because of Shri. Rajiv Mehtaji, a
                  large amount of funds raised to participate in international
                  competitions. At a time when there was no funding from the
                  central government, Rajiv Mehtaji sanctioned the entire cost
                  of players for international tournament.

                  Asian Games, Nepal. No major international competition has
                  been held in India yet, but due to the efforts and initiative
                  of Rajiv Mehta, India has been given the title of Commonwealth
                  Championship in 2020.{" "}

                    international competitions in the recent past ,have had
                    modest performance.Notwithstanding constraint of funds and
                    lack of effective long term training and non-availability of
                    competent and qualified coaches of international calibre and
                    lack of international exposure, the juniors and seniors who
                    had participated in international events are gradually
                    ascending the ranking position, both in international and
                    regional events. The Association had been holding National
                    competitions in Sub-Junior (1999), Cadet (2004), Junior
                    (1992) and Senior (1986) categories, both for boys/men and

                    being played by the Association and National teams
                    participating in international events with creditable
                    performance etc., have perhaps prompted the International
                    and Regional Fencing Federations to request the FAI to host
                    regional and international tournaments in Fencing.

                    benefit the FAI, will give an impetus to the game in the
                    country, adequate exposure to the host team, acquire
                    popularity of the game, test our organizational ability and
